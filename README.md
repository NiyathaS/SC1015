DSAI Project.
Misinformation and disinformation are very harmful to society as it can lead to the spread of dangerous myths which is harmful to society. To combat this, we believe we can make use of Machine Learning models to distinguish between fake news and real news.
For our Preliminary Exploration & Analytic Visualisation, we explored the data using statistical exploration tools to identify news types and to see whether they might reveal a trend.
We chose the Word2Vec model because it will be more accurate to use a model that uses a neural network like Word2Vec. 
Besides the word2Vec model, we used 4 different classification models for cross-referencing.  
We conclude the decision tree model is better than the word2vec model for our fake news detection mini project.
Please note : we split our work equally.
We also changed our project topic quite late into the time given for the project because of issues with our datasets for our previous topic idea.
